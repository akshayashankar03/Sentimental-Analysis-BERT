# Sentimental-Analysis-BERT 
Sentimental Analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text or speech. The purpose of Sentimental Analysis is to determine the overall sentiment of a particular piece of content. In this project, it's aim to perform Sentimental Analysis on a specific website using BERT Algorithm, numpy, pandas, beautiful soup, and webscraping.

# Tools and Technologies:

BERT Algorithm: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a pre-trained transformer-based neural network architecture that is widely used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including Sentimental Analysis.

Numpy:
Numpy is a library for the Python programming language that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Pandas: 
Pandas is a library for the Python programming language that provides data manipulation and analysis tools.

Beautiful Soup: 
Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used for web scraping purposes to extract the data from HTML and XML files.

Web Scraping: 
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated tools.

# Methodology:

Web Scraping: We will use Beautiful Soup and web scraping techniques to extract the data from a specific website.

Data Preprocessing: The extracted data will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information or unwanted characters.

Sentimental Analysis: We will perform Sentimental Analysis on the preprocessed data using the BERT Algorithm to determine the overall sentiment of the website.

Data Analysis and Visualization: The sentiment analysis results will be analyzed and visualized using pandas and numpy to gain insights into the overall sentiment of the website.
